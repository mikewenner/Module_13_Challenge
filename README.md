# Module_13_Challenge
***
## This module challenge uses multiple models of both shallow and deep neural networks for examining organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in an attempt to evaluate and predict success of the organization.
***
## Three total models were built varying parms such as number of hidden layers, incorporation of a dropout layer, and varying the number of epochs used in the analysis.  
***
> The analysis was performed in the venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb found in this repo

> The three models were saved as .h5 files in this repo and are as follows:

1. venture_model.h5 - original model
2. venture_model_A1.h5 - first attempt to optimize model performance
3. venture_model_A2.h5 - second optimization attempt
***
## Overall minimal increase in accuracy was found in the two optimization attempts from the original model.  This would lead me to conclude that more optimization can be undertaken and explored.
